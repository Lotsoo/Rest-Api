How to running? U can download and install "Xampp", save rest-api folder in htdocs, and then click "Apache" start.
Open your browser search "localhost". If it says "Xampp apache bla bla" it means you're connected to apache.
Search again "localhost/rest-api/project-movie/index.html" or "localhost/rest-api/project-pizza/latihan2.html"
